# Multi-winner Approval Voting Ballot Counter

This program reads either approval-style ballots from a CSV file or
ranked-style ballots from a BLT file.  It returns the tallied results to the
console using
* [Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)
* Net Approval Voting
* [Satisfaction Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfaction_approval_voting)
* [Proportional Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_approval_voting)
* [Sequential Proportional Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_proportional_approval_voting)
* [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote)
using [Droop quota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota) and
[Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_system) redistribution

## Build

To build the software from the source code, make sure that you have at least
Java 9, though I recommend installing the latest version of Java.  To check
which Java have installed, if any, run the following command from the command
line:

`java --version`

In addition to Java, building the software from scratch requires Maven, which
can be downloaded from:

https://maven.apache.org/

Once all the project has been downloaded into a directory, and both Java and
Maven have been installed, build using the following command from within the
directory with the project:

`mvn package`

The result of the build will be placed in the `target` subdirectory.

## Running the Project

Once the software has been built or downloaded in JAR form, run the project
using the following command:

`java -jar ./target/ballot-counter-0.0.3.jar <filepath> [seat_count] [max_proportional_slates]`

where <filepath> is the path to the ballot data file.

Optionally, include the number of seats to be filled and the max number of
proportional slates to be returned in the results.

## Data Files

The format of the CSV file consists of a header line with all of the
candidates followed by lines representing each ballot. A non-empty entry in
the same index location (column) as the candidate in the header line
indicates a vote for that candidate. Example:

```
Hillary Clinton,Donald Trump,Gary Johnson,Jill Stein,Mike Maturen
,2,,,5
1,,,,
,,3,4,5
```

indicates that there are five candidates and three ballots with the first
ballot containing votes for Trump and Maturen, the second ballot containing a
vote for Clinton, and the third ballot containing votes for Johnson, Stein,
and Maturen.

Note that this format is easily exportable from [SurveyMonkey](http://www.surveymonkey.com).

The BLT file format is that first described by Hill, Wichmann & Woodall in
_Algorithm 123 - Single Transferable Vote by Meek's method_ (1987) and
popularized by OpenSTV.
